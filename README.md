# 512hash
Creates SHA-512 hash from the given password

Comes as two tools - command line and GUI.

1) Command line just takes a plaintext password as a parameter and throws out the hash.

2) GUI allows user to generate random password or multiple runs.
Password can be copied form clipboard, hash can be copied to.

Zipped distribution files have been provided for Windows and macOS.
There is little sense using this on Linux ;)
